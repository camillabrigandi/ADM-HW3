    "First of all, we notice that there are a lot of courses for which we are addressed to the University's site to see fees' informations, and for these courses, th 'fees' columns says: *\"Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.\"*. For this reason, we replace such stirng with an empty one under the *'fees_EUR'* column in order to speed up operations.   \n",
    "After applying only this operation, we checked and saw that in the 'fees_EUR' column there were now more than 4000 empty rows, making our operaion useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get started with the rest of the preprocessing operations for this column. \n",
    "First of all, we need to retrieve all the money-related numeric values and their currencies. To do so, we used two different regex patterns, one identifing the fees written as *currency* *numeric value* (like £400, for example) and the other one identifieng the reverse couple, so *numeric value* *currency* (ex: 400£). \n",
    "For the currencies simbols we used the pattern found in the second answer gievn here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25978771/what-is-regex-for-currency-symbol, then we added some currency abbreviations, starting from the most common then continuing by personally looking at the rows in the dataset that didn't give us any match to find if we were missing any value. \n",
    "While doing this procedure, we also noticed that between the ones withouth matches, we have a lot of rows structured like the following: \"*UK Fees: 2022/23 fees TBC*;2021/22 fees - 10400   International Fees: 2022/23 fees TBC*;2021/22 fees - 17900*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For these lines, we checked the country (that is always UK, as we suspected), so we assumed that the currency corresponding to the fees values we see is £, even if not explicitly written. \n",
    "For these reasons, for these lines we procede in the following way:\n",
    "1. match 'UK FEES' at the beginnning of the line;\n",
    "2. search for all the numeric values, clean them by removing '.' and ',';\n",
    "3. save numerical values + £ in the 'fees_EUR' column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in order not to match the numeric values corresponding to the academic years, we added a space at the end of each line and looked at numeric values or bounded by two blankspaces, or preceded by an asterisk or a blankspace and followed by a blankspace, which are the only two consistent structures we found for this type of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After retrieving the fees values, we needed to conver them all to a common currency (we chose euros), and return the maximum between them in order to retrieve the highest fee for the lines that have more than one suitable value. We first made the conversion then got the maximum (and not the opposite) since there are some rows where the fees have different currencies, so returning the maximum numeric value and then converting it to euros would be incorrect since we sould be compairing numbers that have different units of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the conversion, we need to convert all the currency symbols and abbreviations found in the dataset into their corresponding ISO currency. To do so, we created a dictionary  that has as keys the currency found in the dataset and as values their ISO correspondacy. This dictionary is loaded here as 'ISO_currency_dict' and has previously been saved into \"ISOcurrency.pkl\" file. Its creation can be seen in file \"files_creation\"."

When computing the tfidf score, by looking at a dataframe computed by the matrix, by changing the names of the columns we saw that the terms wre stored in alhabetical order, leading us to be able to use the tfidf matrix indeces to retrieve the tfidf score for every couple term-document we were interested in. Besides, we used the old inverted_index dictionary to create the new one: this way, when accessing each term's values in the \"old\" inverted index dictionary (remember that the inverted index dictionary has the term ids as keys), we already have the list of the documents in wich the term appears and we don't have to compute it again. In practice, we access every element in the old dictionary and update the new one (that has previously been initialized as an empty one) adding the key corrsponding to the term id we are examinating and setting its value to a dictionary itself containing the key-value pairs (document id, tfidf of the document vs the term) for each document in the list of the old inverted index dictionary."
